# KennecottMinerRecords

This repository provides access to data from personnel records of miner employment from 1900-1919. Records from the Utah Copper Company are handwritten and contain the following employee information: name, date employed, address, dependents, age, weight, height, eyes, hair, gender, and nationality. Data has been transcribed and released as a tsv (Tab Separated Values) file. Technical metadata has been redacted.

The digital collection for the Kennecott Miner Records is available [here](https://collections.lib.utah.edu/search?facet_setname_s=uum_kmr)

Initial transcription for these records was supported by a faculty grant from [Digital Matters](https://digitalmatters.utah.edu/), [University of Utah](https://utah.edu)
