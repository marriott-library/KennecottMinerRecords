# KennecottMinerRecords

Personnel records of miner employment from 1900-1919. Records from the Utah Copper Company are handwritten and contain the following employee information: name, date employed, address, dependents, age, weight, height, eyes, hair, gender, and nationality. Data has been transcribed and released as a tsv file.

Initial transcription for these records was supported by a faculty grant from Digital Matters, University of Utah
